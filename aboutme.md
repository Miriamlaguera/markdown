# Who am i?

Hello there, my name is Miriam Hernandez, I'm 16 years old, and I am the oldest of four.Â 
Eunice and Joselyn. Currently I attend college while still being in high school. I attend Franklin D. Roosevelt High school.
I also attend this college program that the High School i attend at offers..I'm in the Collegiate Program, where it allows me to attend college classes
at the same times as high school. At this rate I will be graduating on the year of 2020 and i will be graduating with my associates degree.I honestly did not plan to be where I am today nor to be attending these classes. I used to live in Irving, where i spent most of my childhood.
Bowie Middle School was the middle school i use to attend to, and i also attended Lee Britain Elementary school.Through out the years of my childhood,
my mother wanted to buy a house really bad, at one point she started looking for houses near where we lived by, but unfortunately we didn't have any
luck finding one. Eventually my mom found some houses in Oak Cliff, and well we found one we all liked, in a great neighbor hood. After finding the
house shes has been wanting, we ended up moving here. I had just finished middle school, so I would be joining a High school. After moving here to
Oak Cliff i ended up looking for the High schools near where I lived, and when i found out which school I was attending, I did some research. On my
first week at Roosevelt, they had mention a program where we can be taking College credit classes and we could end up graduating with an associates
degree. I honestly got really interested and I signed up because it sounded like a great opportunity. After entering the program,
I started to communicate alot more and also participate with a lot of people to really fun things.
